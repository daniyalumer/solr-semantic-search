History of Fatimid Foundation
How It Began:
The journey that began in a small room on the pavement of Britto Road, Karachi, Pakistan has gradually blossomed into the largest voluntary health care and blood transfusion service providing thousands of bags of healthy fully screened blood and blood products each month to its thousands of patients (majority of whom are children) suffering from dreadful blood disorders i.e. thalassaemia, hemophilia and other blood disorders.
Today Fatimid centres are located in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Multan, Quetta ,Hyderabad, Rashidabad and Khairpur.
Why It Came Into Existence:
The absence of an adequate, effective, safe-free of charge National Blood Transfusion Services is an important health-system problem that Pakistan faces today. The requirement of blood transfusion for potentially preventable maternal morbidity and mortality is quite high in Pakistan. Creation of Blood-intensive specialist Centres for Cancer surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Renal Dialysis, Renal transplantation, Cardiovascular by-pass surgery, Thalassaemia, Haemophilia, Leukaemia etc, have all led to an even greater need for blood and blood products.
It is estimated that, Pakistan requires around 8,000+ units of blood everyday, while the transfusion needs outstrip the current availability of blood. The collection and supply of safe blood is further reduced with the fairly high prevalence rate of Hepatitis B & C viruses found amongst the potential blood donors. Although systematic surveys have not been carried out in all areas of the country, it is estimated that around ten million suffer from the viruses of Hepatitis B and C. The danger of spreading HIV infections, even in low-incidence country like Pakistan further complicates the situation.
Transmission of HIV and Hepatitis infections through blood and blood products therefore, demands adequate supply of un-infected 'Safe Blood' for the transfusions. Fatimid Foundation feels proud
